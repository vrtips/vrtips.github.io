It clips!!!! WHY!?

In this post we will examine more in depth what the Future proof Publish option does in the VRChat SDK control panel. This post is a bit technical but I will try to put a simple explanation as conclusion for those of you who only wanted to know what and why.
Where is it? If you open your VRChat SDK control panel in unity and go to the Settings tab you will see a &amp;ldquo;Future Proof Publish&amp;rdquo; option which at the moment of writing is by default off.</description></item><item><title>Avatars under the minimum size limit</title><link>https://vrtips.github.io/posts/small/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 01:39:35 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://vrtips.github.io/posts/small/</guid><description>Uploading avatars under the minimum size limit There are a couple of reasons why you might want to upload an avatar under the minimum size: maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a false positive, maybe you just want that extra less centimeters or maybe you&amp;rsquo;re just curious.
In any case, this post will guide you on how to remove the limit and how to fix yourself in case your avatar won&amp;rsquo;t allow you to switch back to your normal avatar (or open the quick menu completely).</description></item><item><title>Avatar Toggles</title><link>https://vrtips.github.io/posts/toggles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 14:31:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://vrtips.github.io/posts/toggles/</guid><description>Avatar Toggles In this post I want to showcase 2 ways to make avatar toggles for SDK3 avatars.
Methods There are 2 ways to make toggles, one is the most common ones if you look at tutorials online and follows the VRChat request/standard to not use &amp;ldquo;Write Defaults&amp;rdquo; in animations. The other is an alternative way that goes a bit against the standard put in by VRChat but is, in my opinion and only for simple toggles, a little bit faster and less prone to errors.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://vrtips.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vrtips.github.io/about/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Computer science grad and CyberSecurity student.
